# Longitudinal-prediction
Acquiring information in more than one MR modality in the same patient promises to reveal more detail about neuroplasticity.
However, the differences in the data from each modality, and the lack of a standard multimodal data analysis scheme (even when most of this data is available) make
clinical outcome prediction, such as whether a patient can walk or perform self-care activities, a nontrivial task. Several studies have shown that it is possible to train
machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the clinical outcomes. ML algorithms have proven useful because such algorithms can gather hidden associations between
multimodal MR data and clinical outcome of SCI patients. A key advantage of ML is its ability to objectively extract useful features and its flexibility to readily revise them
as more data becomes available. Currently, we have longitudinal multimodal data from 24 SCI patients & 23 healthy controls and we aim to build ML tools based on
these data & predict the clinical outcomes
